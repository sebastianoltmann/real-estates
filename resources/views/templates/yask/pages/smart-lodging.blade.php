        Frequent travelers tend away from traditional hotels into hubs; hybrid home-offices with “couleur locale”.
        New working and new living are words for a sustainable life based on nature, efficiency and empowering people to
        enjoy.
    </p>

    <p>But just smart is not enough, “gezelligheid” (Dutch for cosiness) is another key-factor; the natural warmth of
        feeling home.<br>
        Cosy-Catchy-Cool is the key to blur the lines between residential and transient, hotel and home, social and
        private.
