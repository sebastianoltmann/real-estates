    <p>
        Our product is working with the “grain”; we love the challenge of branding solutions together with Architects
        and Developers.<br>
        We believe that nature is unique and deserves a personalized approach only. Hence no stock or standard products.

    <p>"Yask" is not just a word. It is not just a brand. It is a group of people who work with a DNA that will always
        be cool.<br>
        We love nature, we hate polished, mass produced, identical factory uniformity.</p>

    <p>
        To inspire with the unusual is our backbone.
