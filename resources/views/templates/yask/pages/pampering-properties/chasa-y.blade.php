        Near Scuol and not far from famous ski-resorts as St. Moritz, Davos and Samnaun, the centuries old customs house
        “Chasa Y” is located. Here on an altitude of 1470 meters amongst original Engadin architecture Ronald and his
        family
        enjoy the majestic views of the Alps in an authentic and impressive Chasa of 650 sqm.
    </p>

    <p>The core of the house centuries ago was used as a customs house, located on the border of the village, visitors
        had to pay their local taxes there when entering. These Engadin houses are extremely large and often used for
        stable and livestock area on the ground floors and shared by two or more families upstairs.
    </p>

    <p>
        But here all available 650 sqm were sculpted together to keep and express the rich history of the building. <br>
        It was a condition for the designers, Juan Nibbelink and South African Glynn Jones to preserve all original
        spaces and elements of the house. Together with local hand workers it took 2 years, 243 tons of sand, stones and
        endless thinking.
    </p>

    <p>Now an impressive 80 cm thick stonewall front, with old funnel-shaped windows plus shutters and traditional grey “sgraffito” on the edges, covering 4 levels of living with 4 ground entrances and 4 functions is facing a new age.
        All 4 kids are grown-ups now, going around the world. </p>

        In 2022 the Chasa-Y comes available; <a href="http://www.chasayask.com" target="_blank">www.ChasaYask.com</a>
