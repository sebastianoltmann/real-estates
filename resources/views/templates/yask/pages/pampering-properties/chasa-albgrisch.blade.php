        Since Sent was featured on the cover of the Wall Street Journal magazine telling about the astonishing and
        eclectic art collections of Sperone and Not Vital, followed by another in the New York Times about the huge
        investments of Ms Grazyna Kulczyk Art Foundation in a new Museum Susch, the region is a hot-spot among artists.

    <p>Although a still well-kept secret, the region is much sought-after among the well-known form Zurich.<br>
        In just 3 hours the madness of a big city is replaced by the beauty and tranquility normally seen on postcards
        only.<br>

        The Chasa AlbGrisch is located in the very center of the village between the old bakery and butchery. <br>
        The front with its traditional Engadin roofing and the beautiful bowed entrance doors is used as banner on many mailings. <br>
        Also the traditional split between the living and the farm is still in place giving an exceptional space to develop something unique.
