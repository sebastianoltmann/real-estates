                                            <p>
                                                Located at the west entrance of the village and just opposite a centuries old water spring we find the chasaCHAU.
                                                <br/><br/>
                                                During the terrible village fire in 1921 in which many houses and stables burned down, the East side of this majestic building was also partly destroyed.
                                                <br/>
                                                <br/>
                                                However, most of its structure could be saved and rebuilt, including the impressive 80 cm thick stonewalls, some with old funnel-shaped windows plus shutters and traditional grey “sgraffito” on the edges, covering 5 levels of living.
                                            </p>

                                            <p>Some decades later, the vast size and central position of the building - just behind a famous water spring, with the trail to Scuol and Vastur in front of the door and the famous Traumpiste ending just the street above - attracted early tourists and in fact first hospitality was born.
                                                <br/>
                                                <br/>
                                                As the region became better known, there was a need for authenticity to be paired……….
                                                <br/>
                                                <br/>
                                                Authenticity needed to be paired with a certain luxury and it took the previous owners too
                                                long to realize this which unfortunately left the beautiful Chasa standing neglected for many years.

                                            <p>When Ronald came to this village he fell in love with this property immediately.
                                                But it took him a long ride to agree with the owners to sell-on this beauty.
